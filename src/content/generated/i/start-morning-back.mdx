Maybe there's another way in.

There's an alley a few shops down, between a tailor and a travel agent (both closed, curtains drawn). You glance back along the street and, seeing nobody, start down the downward slope of the alley, curving around the back of the tailor.

Soon you reach a dead end, and what can only be the back of the Cafe Halcyon hanging above you. The ground floor of the cafe is long, but you're now below street level.

There's a little iron door with a wire mesh screen that you can't quite see through, and a window the size of your hand. A lantern burns beside it. In the corner is an ill-contained pile of cafe detritus: cardboard boxes, empty tins, milk crates. The smell of bread down here is strong.

1. Knock on the door. [[start-morning-back-knock]]
2. Root through the pile of trash. [[start-morning-back-trash-i]]
3. Put out the lantern. [[start-morning-back-lantern]]
4. Leave the alley. [[start-morning-outside]]
