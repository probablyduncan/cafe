The mouse stares up at you. There is wonder in its eyes. You are its god. It sits, motionless beside the storm drain, watching.

Rainwater drips out the end of the croissant as you raise it to your lips. It's fluffy and flaky. Sure, it's a little flat, and a little cold, but you've never seen anything so golden in your life.

You take a bite, chew. There's a pain in your chest. 

It's disgusting, of course. You spit it out. The mouse breaks from its stupor and darts down the drain.

What's gotten into you? You drop the croissant and try your best to kick the mess of garbage back into a pile. Hopefully nobody will notice.
