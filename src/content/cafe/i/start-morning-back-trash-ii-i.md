There's a heap of cans like billiard balls beside the door.

You step back, gauge the angle, and run at them. As you swing your right leg to kick, your left foot lands on a patch of grease, and you loose your balance, tumbling forward into the pile of trash.

Suddenly, you feel something move beneath you.
