You pick up one of the boxes in the pile. *Jalapeños & Anchos — Tinned — Extra Large*, it says. The J in *jalapeño* is a wiry little pepper with big eyes and a wide grin.

You brush aside more boxes, cans, egg cartons. There's a half-sack of flour, gone moldy. You kick it over.

Underneath, you find a box of toothpicks, unopened. Score! You put them in your pocket.

What other treasures can you find in this garden of leftovers?
