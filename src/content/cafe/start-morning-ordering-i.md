You walk up to the counter, which is a wide glass case. Aside from an enamel bowl of tomatoes and a few loose tortillas, it's mostly empty.

The woman behind the counter looks you up and down. She's old and her hair is all over the place. Like a hedgehog.

"What can I get for you?" she asks.

You don't see a menu anywhere.

1. What do you *have*? [[start-morning-ordering-ii-i]]
2. **One cheese sandwich, please.** [[start-morning-ordering-ii-ii]]
3. Coffee and a cigarette. [[start-morning-ordering-ii-iii]]
4. Tell her to surprise you. [[start-morning-ordering-ii-iv]]
5. Ask her what her name is. [[start-morning-ordering-ii-v]]
